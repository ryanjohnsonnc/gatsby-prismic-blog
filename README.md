# The Portfolio (A Gatsby & Prismic App)

A portfolio and blog app powered by [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) to showcase my work and give me a location to dump my ramblings.


## ðŸš€ Requirements for usage

1. Gatsby CLI

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project. If you don't have the CLI installed already, see [Gastby instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli).

```sh
gatsby new PROJECT-NAME REPO-URL
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into the new site's directory, install node modules, and start it up.

```sh
cd PROJECT-NAME
npm install
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_.
