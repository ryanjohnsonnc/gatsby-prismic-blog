# The Portfolio (A Gatsby & Prismic App)

A portfolio and blog app powered by [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) to showcase my work and give me a location to dump my ramblings.


## ðŸš€ Requirements for usage

```sh
cd PROJECT-NAME
npm install
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_.
